    #
    # ## Quick Start
    # In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following steps:
    #
    # 1. [Select or create a Cloud Platform project.](https://console.cloud.google.com/project)
    # 2. [Enable the Stackdriver Monitoring API.](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/monitoring)
    # 3. [Setup Authentication.](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud/master/guides/authentication)
    #
    # ### Installation
    # ```
    # $ gem install google-cloud-monitoring
    # ```
    #
    # ### Preview
    # #### MetricServiceClient
    # ```rb
    # require "google/cloud/monitoring/v3"
    #
    # metric_service_client = Google::Cloud::Monitoring::V3::MetricServiceClient.new
    # formatted_name = Google::Cloud::Monitoring::V3::MetricServiceClient.project_path(project_id)
    #
    # # Iterate over all results.
    # metric_service_client.list_monitored_resource_descriptors(formatted_name).each do |element|
    #   # Process element.
    # end
    #
    # # Or iterate over results one page at a time.
    # metric_service_client.list_monitored_resource_descriptors(formatted_name).each_page do |page|
    #   # Process each page at a time.
    #   page.each do |element|
    #     # Process element.
    #   end
